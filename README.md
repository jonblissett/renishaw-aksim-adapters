# renishaw-aksim-adapters

This repository includes adapters to convert the [Renishaw Aksim 
series](http://www.directindustry.com/prod/renishaw/product-5200-1654055.html)
encoders for different signalling methods. 

Currently only an adapter for differential signalling. The adapters are 
designed to be the same form factor as the encoder itself, so they can be placed in the same housing.
