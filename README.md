# renishaw-aksim-adapters

This repository includes adapters to convert the [Renishaw Aksim 
series](http://www.directindustry.com/prod/renishaw/product-5200-1654055.html)
encoders for different signalling methods. 

The adapters are designed to be the same form factor as the encoder itself, so they can be placed in the same 
housing alongside the encoder.
